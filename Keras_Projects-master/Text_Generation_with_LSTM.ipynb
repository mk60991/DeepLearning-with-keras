    "### Text Generation With LSTM\n",
    "\n",
    "We’ll explore how recurrent neural networks can be used to generate sequence data. We’ll use text generation as an example, but the exact same techniques can be generalized to any kind of sequence data: we could apply it to sequences of musical notes in order to generate new music, to timeseries of brushstroke data (for example, recorded while an artist paints on an iPad) to generate paintings stroke by stroke, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sequence data generation is in no way limited to artistic content generation. It has been successfully applied to speech synthesis and to dialogue generation for chatbots.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to Generate Sequence Data?\n",
    "The universal way to generate sequence data in deep learning is to train a network (usually an RNN or a convnet) to predict the next token or next few tokens in a sequence, using the previous tokens as input. For instance, given the input “the cat is on the ma,” the network is trained to predict the target t, the next character. As usual when working with text data, tokens are typically words or characters, and any network that can model the probability of the next token given the previous ones is called a language model. A language model captures the latent space of language: its statistical structure.\n",
    "Once we have such a trained language model, we can sample from it (generate new sequences): we feed it an initial string of text (called conditioning data), ask it to generate the next character or the next word (we can even generate several tokens at\n",
    "once), add the generated output back to the input data, and repeat the process many times. This loop allows us to generate sequences of arbitrary length that reflect the structure of the data on which the model was trained: sequences that look almost like human-written sentences. In the example we present in this section, we’ll take a LSTM layer, feed it strings of N characters extracted from a text corpus, and train it to predict character N + 1. The output of the model will be a softmax over\n",
    "all possible characters: a probability distribution for the next character. This LSTM is called a **character-level neural language model**.\n",
    "\n",
    "![capture](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13174586/51816249-b02e6400-22eb-11e9-9d09-6907e73d7082.JPG)\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Importance of The Sampling Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "When generating text, the way we choose the next character is crucially important. A naive approach is ***greedy sampling***, consisting of always choosing the most likely next character. But such an approach results in repetitive, predictable strings that don’t look like coherent language. A more interesting approach makes slightly more surprising choices: it introduces randomness in the sampling process, by sampling from the probability distribution for the next character. This is called ***stochastic sampling*** (recall that stochasticity is what we call randomness in this field). In such a setup, if e has a probability 0.3 of being the next character, according to the model, we’ll choose it 30% of the time. Note that greedy sampling can be also cast as sampling from a probability distribution: one where a certain character has probability 1 and all others have probability 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sampling probabilistically from the softmax output of the model is neat: it allows even unlikely characters to be sampled some of the time, generating more interesting looking sentences and sometimes showing creativity by coming up with new, realistic sounding words that didn’t occur in the training data. But there’s one issue with this strategy: it doesn’t offer a way to *control the amount of randomness* in the sampling process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why would we want more or less randomness? Consider an extreme case: pure random sampling, where we draw the next character from a uniform probability distribution, and every character is equally likely. This scheme has maximum randomness; in other words, this probability distribution has maximum entropy. Naturally, it won’t produce anything interesting. At the other extreme, greedy sampling doesn’t produce anything interesting, either, and has no randomness: the corresponding probability distribution has minimum entropy. Sampling from the “real” probability distribution—the distribution that is output by the model’s softmax function—constitutes an intermediate point between these two extremes. But there are many other intermediate points of higher or lower entropy that we may want to explore. Less entropy will give the generated sequences a more predictable structure (and thus they will potentially be more realistic looking), whereas more entropy will result in more surprising and creative sequences. When sampling from generative models, it’s always good to explore different amounts of randomness in the generation process. Because we—humans—are the ultimate judges of how interesting the generated data is, interestingness is highly subjective, and there’s no telling in advance where the point of optimal entropy lies.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to control the amount of stochasticity in the sampling process, we’ll introduce a parameter called the ***softmax temperature*** that characterizes the entropy of the probability distribution used for sampling: it characterizes how surprising or predictable the choice of the next character will be. Given a temperature value, a new probability distribution is computed from the original one (the softmax output of the model) by reweighting it in the following way.\n",

In this example, we’ll use some of the writings of Nietzsche, the late-nineteenth century German philosopher (translated into English).

    "As we can see, a low temperature value results in extremely repetitive and predictable text, but local structure is highly realistic: in particular, all words (a word being a local pattern of characters) are real English words. With higher temperatures, the generated text becomes more interesting, surprising, even creative; it sometimes invents completely new words that sound somewhat plausible. With a high temperature, the local structure starts to break down, and most words look like semi-random strings of characters. Without a doubt, 0.5 is the most interesting temperature for text generation in this specific setup. Always experiment with multiple sampling strategies! A clever balance between learned structure and randomness is what makes generation interesting.\n",

    "Note that by training a bigger model, longer, on more data, wew can achieve generated samples that look much more coherent and realistic than this one. But, of course, we can't expect to ever generate any meaningful text, other than by random chance: all we’re doing is sampling data from a statistical model of which characters come after which characters. Language is a communication channel, and there’s a distinction between what communications are about and the statistical structure of the messages in which communications are encoded. To evidence this distinction, here’s a thought experiment: what if human language did a better job of compressing communications, much like computers do with most digital communications? Language would be no less meaningful, but it would lack any intrinsic statistical structure, thus making it impossible to learn a language model as we just did."
